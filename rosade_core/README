ROS/ADE (v0.1)
==============

This package consits of ROS/ADE bridge classes which allow other
components to communicate with ROS.

Class Generator
---------------

The class generator introspects into a running ROS system and allows
you to generate an ADE component which has bidirectional communication
to a node. Currently it only looks for a ROS master in the default
setup and does not support connecting to an arbitrary master (although
exporting the`ROS_MASTER_URI` variable in your shell settings should
allow it to overcome this problem.

### Build ###

To build, run `./gradlew installApp`.

### Run  ###

You can then run the ROS/ADE class generator with:

`./build/install/rosade/bin/rosade -m edu.tufts.hrilab.rosade.core 'nodename'`

or you can invoke the GUI

`./build/install/rosade/bin/rosade -m edu.tufts.hrilab.rosade.core -g`

Generated Classes
-----------------

Generated class should be placed under `edu/tufts/hrilab/rosade` and checked into
source control. 

TODO
----

- Support ROS services
- Allow dyanmic_reconfig for nodes which support it
- Allow modification of the ROS parameter tree
